# Extensions for .NET
by [@jhanssens](https://twitter.com/jhanssens)

## Introduction
This package provides helpers and extensions for .NET projects. It's just a [bunch of gists](https://gist.github.com/hanssens) just to make [my own life as a developer](http://hanssens.com) a bit more convenient. More importantly, it is built with 100% pure love. And 100% in pure, managed c#.
